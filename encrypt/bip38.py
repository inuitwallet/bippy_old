def intermediate(passphrase):
	"""
	Encrypting a private key with EC multiplication offers the ability for someone to generate encrypted keys knowing only an EC point derived from the original passphrase and
	some salt generated by the passphrase's owner, and without knowing the passphrase itself.
	Only the person who knows the original passphrase can decrypt the private key.
	A code known as an intermediate code conveys the information needed to generate such a key without knowledge of the passphrase.

	This methodology does not offer the ability to encrypt a known private key - this means that the process of creating encrypted keys is also the process of generating new addresses.
	On the other hand, this serves a security benefit for someone possessing an address generated this way:
	if the address can be recreated by decrypting its private key with a passphrase, and it's a strong passphrase one can be certain only he knows himself,
	then he can safely conclude that nobody could know the private key to that address.

	The person who knows the passphrase and who is the intended beneficiary of the private keys is called the owner.
	He will generate one or more "intermediate codes", which are the first factor of a two-factor redemption system, and will give them to someone else we'll call printer,
	who generates a key pair with an intermediate code can know the address and encrypted private key, but cannot decrypt the private key without the original passphrase.

	An intermediate code should, but is not required to, embed a printable "lot" and "sequence" number for the benefit of the user.
	The proposal forces these lot and sequence numbers to be included in any valid private keys generated from them.
	An owner who has requested multiple private keys to be generated for him will be advised by applications to ensure that each private key has a unique lot and sequence number
	consistent with the intermediate codes he generated.
	These mainly help protect owner from potential mistakes and/or attacks that could be made by printer.

	The "lot" and "sequence" number are combined into a single 32 bit number.
	20 bits are used for the lot number and 12 bits are used for the sequence number,
	such that the lot number can be any decimal number between 0 and 1048575, and the sequence number can be any decimal number between 0 and 4095.
	For programs that generate batches of intermediate codes for an owner,
	it is recommended that lot numbers be chosen at random within the range 100000-999999 and that sequence numbers are assigned starting with 1.

	Steps performed by owner to generate a single intermediate code, if lot and sequence numbers are being included:

	#The resulting string will start with the word "passphrase" due to the constant bytes,
	#will be 72 characters in length, and encodes 49 bytes (8 bytes constant + 8 bytes ownerentropy + 33 bytes passpoint).
